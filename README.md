This Python script shows you the latest news titles from HJK web easy Japanese.

It retrieves the XML from a subreddit and displays the titles in the console.

Clone it and run:

(If you don't have bs4 and requests installed)
`pip install bs4`;
`pip install requests`;

(And then:)
`python news.py`.
